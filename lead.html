            <p>Lead guitar is the musical part of a song were the guitarist picks the chords plays along melodically
              with the rest of the group and play's an instrumental were there may be a gap between verses, known as a
              solo. This is were the guitarist would play a group of notes named a, "riff." </p>
            <p>All of this builds up within the song structure and then explodes into the solo part of the song. The
              solo is usually the section of a song that is the inspiration for a anyone deciding to learn the
              guitar.<br><b> For all voice commands for this website, just say, "What to say" at any time to open the

            <h2>The Electric Guitar</h2>
            <p>The solo of any song can also be played on an acoustic guitar, but it is the electric guitar that
              releases those tones, effects and distortion we are all familiar with. There are many variations of an
              electric guitar but they all work
              off the same principal. Electro-Magnetic pick ups.
              The guitar itself has minimal electricity running through it, so it would be impossible to give the player
              an electric shock but it does happen to connect to an amplifier which enables the sound to travel through
              to a speaker. Given this
              extra affordance many sound effects can be achieved which is what makes this instrument so versatile and
              popular through out the years and probably a lot more.</p>

            <h4>The need for an <b>Electric</b> Guitar surfaced as orchestras' started to increase in size, they also
              became much louder. The 1920's Big Band's achieved their sound through heavy drum beats and brass
              instruments and the acoustic guitar couldn't be heard over the sound. Before the invention of the pick up
              musicians would use microphones from old telephones, of which, usually broke under the constant usage and
              damage.</h4>

              The first electric guitar was invented in 1931 by George Beauchamp and Adolf Rickenbacker and later
              patented in 1937 under the Rickenbacker name. </p>
