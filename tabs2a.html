            <h1>Tablature</h1>
            <p>Tablature (pronounced tab for short) is a musical sheet conversion from note to numbers. The numbers
              represent which fret to play on your guitar, and the horizontal lines represent the string to play it on.
              There are other symbols to keep alert for as well, such as sliding and bending a note, hammer-on,
              pull-off, rake and glisten.
              There is no requirement to learn how to read sheet music using this method.</p>
          </section>
          <div id="tablature-placeholder">
          </div>
          <section class="tablature-description">
            <p>This is guitar tablature, it does look like a musical stave and it is designed to imitate one too. The
              musical notes have all been translated and conveniently numbered onto what looks like another stave.
              However it is not, as musical staves have 5 lines, this translation has 6 lines. Conveying that the
              numbers are indicating where to place your finger tips on the fret board, the horizontal lines indicate
              which string to play. <br>
              The first set of numbers in the diagram seem to be a clutter of numbers and seem quite confusing at first,
              this is how chords are written in tablature form. Whereas previously chords were written in a diagram, or
              chord box, this method describes the last three strings, strings G, B and high E, are fretted 7, 7 and 5
              respectfully this is also strummed just like before. Numbers on their own (solo) are picked just as they
              would in a guitar solo. </p>
