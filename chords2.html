          <h1>The Power Chord</h1>
          <p>The <b>Power</b> chord is only played on the bass strings so it adds more depth, or power, to songs. A
            lot of songs that are played with distortion tend to have them in or were an added effect is required on
            top of the harmonics with the added strength and veracity of the bass notes.<br> It was invented by an
            American during the 1900's, he wasn't aiming for these effects he was playing them because he was born
            with only two fingers on each hand.<br><b> For all voice commands for this website, just say, "What to
              say" at any time to open the Help Box.</b><br>

          <h2> The F Power Chord. </h2>
          <div class="card-power1" aria-label="image of the F Barre chord">
          </div>
          <p> This type of Power chord is played the most through out any music that has a Power Chord.
            If you did see that it's very similar to an F-Barre Chord explained earlier, then you're correct - it
            is!<br>In the Chord Diagram, the circles signify where to place your finger tips, note that there are two
            lower circles together and a top level one also. The note played on the first fret is called the root note
            simply because its the first bass note. In all, this is the F (root note) Power Chord.

          <h2>The B Flat Power Chord</h2>
          <div class="card2-power"></div>
          <p>This Power chord is played on the B flat root note (1st fret and 2nd string) hence the name. It has
            exactly the same shape as the previous power chord, except each finger stays on the same fret but moves
            down just one string each.
            <br>If you are learning for the first time, Power chords are without any reasonable doubt the best chord
            to start with.
            <br>
            It's called a Power Chord because of it's drive <i>and</i> the added power a learner would get from
            starting to learn with this type of chord <i>and</i> the added power a learner would get from starting to
            learn with this type of chord.

        <div class="outro-power">
          <p>A power chord is, in fact, a diad which is 2 notes played together. Guitar power chords are very
            versatile, since the shape can be moved all over the fretboard, as with bar chords. Power chords are
            mostly played on electric guitars under distortion.</p>
