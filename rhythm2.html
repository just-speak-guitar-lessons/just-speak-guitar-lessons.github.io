                                beats between main beats and this is were the upwards strum come's into play. So far we
                                have
                                worked out that we count in 4 second beats and for each beat we strum downwards.
                                The extra beat usually follows the third beat and can be tricky to master especially
                                with
                                chord changes. One way to overcome this is to count out loud at first, " 1, 2, 3, and
                                4."
                                Saying the word, "and, " will remind you to include the upwards strum.<br><b> For all

                                You should by now have learned how to hold the guitar, where to position your fingers
                                whilst
                                playing a chord and hopefully how to strum in time too. So now is the time to learn a
                                basic
                                song to start you playing the Rhythm guitar.

                            One of the most influential artist of all times, is Jimmy Hendrix. In addition to playing
                            with his teeth, behind his back, or without touching the instrument’s strings, he also
                            played his guitar upside down, although there was a very simple reason for that, he was
                            left-handed. Most of his songs were created using the Power Chord. His version of, "All
                            Along the Watchtower," is hailed as a masterpiece, using just one of the Power Chords from
                            this tutorial and a strum pattern already explained, its time for a lesson.</p>

                            This Power Chord was explained in a previous section of this web site, it is the
                            simplest chord to learn and with enough practice will power drive your way into
                            mastering this song and many more to come too! The chord diagram on the left explains
                            clearly were you should place your finger tips and also, if you remember from a previous
                            tutorial, which fingers tips go where.<br> Don't worry if you have forgotten which
                            number belongs to which finger, the hand diagram, displayed lower, clearly identifies
                            where each finger goes with its respectful number. On the chord diagram the dots
                            represent where you should fret the board along with each corresponding finger number.

                            The Power Chord above is called the F-Power Chord and the actual shape will not change
                            all of the way through this song, sometimes keeping it simple is the best way to learn
                            anything in life. Practice this chord before starting the lesson, sometimes a beginner
                            may not be fretting the string hard enough, the easiest way to find out if you are
                            playing it correctly is simply by listening. Play each string with your plectrum, is
                            each string playing the right sound?
                            If you find that some or even all of the strings are making the wrong sound, for
                            example, a slight buzzing sound or if the sound is muted then press harder on the
                            strings and repeat until each string sounds correct.<br>Once you are confident in
                            playing this chord on different frets, each note is sounding as it should then you are
                            ready for the lesson.

                            Beats can help measure tempos and are performed in grooves and rhythmic music. They measure
                            the
                            pulse and rhythm of a musical piece. They are usually divided into two kinds: stressed and
                            unstressed. Stressed beats are the 'strong' beats and unstressed are the 'weak' beats.
